## Introduction

Using the platform's native web view alone may not provide a seamless real-time experience in a native app.
To ensure stability, it is recommended to integrate Pagecall using platform-specific SDKs.

<Warning>
Currently, the native SDK does not support video functionality and only provides whiteboard and voice-based meeting capabilities.
If video functionality is essential for your service, please reach out to sales@pagecall.com for further assistance.

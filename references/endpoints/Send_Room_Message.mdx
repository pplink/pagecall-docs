openapi: "POST /rooms/{room_id}/message"
---

A message sent needs to be handled as below.
Unless it is handled by the client-side SDK, it does nothing.

```tsx
<Pagecall
  onMessage={(message) => {
    // On a successful api call,
    // this callback is called with the same `message` value as in the request body
  }}
/>
```

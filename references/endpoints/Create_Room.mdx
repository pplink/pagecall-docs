### Webhook

When you create a room with webhook parameters,
a webhook will be sent via a POST method for each participant's entry and exit.
The request body for this is as follows.

```ts
{
  action: "sessionLeft" | "sessionJoined",
  payload: {
    roomId: string,
    userId?: string,
    memberId: string,
    sessionId: string,
    sessionsCount: number,
    membersCount: number,
    timestamp: string // e.g. '2022-05-31T12:38:15.059Z'
  }
}
```

Pagecall provides an APIs for seamless integration with existing user databases. Let's say you are using Pagecall for one-on-one tutoring services. To ensure an effective tutoring experience, the following features are required:

- Register user within the workspace
- Create a meeting room for tutoring
- Invite user to join the created meeting room

This document provides examples for implementing each of these features.

## Register user to the workspace

Pagecall manages users in the workspace scope. You can invite or change the permission of invited users. To register a user to the workspace using API, you can use the [Create User](/references/endpoints/Create_User) API.

```js
const axios = require("axios");

const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";

const user_id = "USER_ID_ASSIGNED_BY_YOUR_SERVICE"; // required
const name = "USER_NAME"; // optional
const profile_url = "USER_PROFILE_IMAGE_URL"; // optional

axios
  .post(
    "https://api.pagecall.com/v1/users",
    { user_id, name, profile_url },
    { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}` } }
  )
  .then((response) => {
    const { user } = response.data;
    // User created with AccessToken: TfowtRYBs0E_trzoTaCmAXKzB1JxDDhi
    console.log(`User created with AccessToken:`, user.access_token);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error creating user:", error);
  });
```

Remember that the users created by Pagecall API can not access the Pagecall console. Instead, using the `access_token`, user can join the room with authentication that anonymous user can not access.

## Create a meeting room

After registering a user to the workspace, you can create a meeting room that can be either public or private, which only authenticated users can join. Below is an example code snippet using the [Create Room](/references/endpoints/Create_Room) API to create a private one-on-one meeting room:

```js
const axios = require("axios");

const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
const mentor_user_id = "USER_ID_ASSIGNED_BY_YOUR_SERVICE";
const mentee_user_id = "USER_ID_ASSIGNED_BY_YOUR_SERVICE";

axios
  .post(
    "https://api.pagecall.com/v1/rooms",
    {
      name: "One-on-One Meeting, Ashley & Jayden",
      type: "private", // Could be one of 'open', 'public' or 'private'
      members: [
        { user_id: mentor_user_id, type: "host" },
        { user_id: mentee_user_id, type: "guest" },
      ],
    },
    { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}` } }
  )
  .then((response) => {
    const { room } = response.data;
    console.log(`Meeting room created with ID:`, room.id);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error creating meeting room:", error);
  });
```

As shown in the example, a private one-on-one meeting room is created and has two members, the mentor as the host and the mentee as the guest.

In Pagecall, the user joined the meeting room is called the `member`. To add or update the member states, check the [Member](/references/endpoints/List_Member) APIs.

Additionally, there are three different types for room:

- `open`: Anyone, including anonymous users, can join the room without an invitation or approval.
- `public`: All users registered in the same workspace can join the room.
- `private`: Only invited users can join the room.

## Invite user to join the created meeting room

Now that you have created a meeting room, you can invite users to join it. One way to do this is by generating an invite link for each user in the following format:

```js
return redirect(
  302,
  `https://app.pagecall.com/meet?room_id=${room.id}&access_token=${user.access_token}`
);
```

When the user joins the meeting using the generated URL, they will automatically be logged in as the specified user.
